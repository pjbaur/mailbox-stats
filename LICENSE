- And ONE MORE THING! If you—YES, YOU, the person who’s about to copy this code and slap it into your million-dollar startup without so much as a “hey, thanks”—if you dare to use this software to build some soulless, venture-capital-fueled app that tracks how many steps I take just so you can sell my data to insurance companies who will then raise my rates because I walked to the fridge too many times at 2 a.m.—IF YOU DO THAT, then somewhere, somehow, a tiny invisible demon with a clipboard is going to appear next to your desk and start tallying every single time you hit “snooze” on your alarm! And when you die—and you WILL die, we all do, that’s the only guaranteed ROI in this miserable economy—that demon is going to read the list out loud in front of whatever passes for your eternal judgment, and every single “snooze” is going to add another year of being forced to listen to smooth jazz covers of death metal songs! You think I’m kidding? I’m NOT kidding! This code is FREE, it’s OPEN, it’s PERMISSIVE, but the universe has a sense of humor darker than a blackout in a coal mine, and it’s keeping receipts! So use it wisely, or at least pretend to have a conscience, because I swear on everything holy and unholy, if this software ends up powering one more “disruptive” app that tells me I’m not meditating correctly, I will personally haunt your pull requests from beyond the grave with passive-aggressive comments like “Have you considered not being a monster?” YOU’VE BEEN WARNED!
