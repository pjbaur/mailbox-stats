## Claude code notes

⏺ I've created a CLAUDE.md file for this repository. Since this is an early-stage project with no code yet, I've kept it minimal and focused on the essential information:

  1. Project Overview: Describes what the tool does - analyzing Gmail data to find top senders by count and size
  2. Tech Stack: Documents the key technologies (Python 3.12, GCP, Gmail API)
  3. Project Status: Notes that this is early-stage, so future Claude instances understand the context

  As you develop the project and add code, build scripts, tests, and establish architectural patterns, you can expand this file with:
  - Build/test/lint commands
  - Authentication setup for Gmail API
  - GCP configuration details
  - Code architecture and module organization
  - Any specific development workflows you establish
